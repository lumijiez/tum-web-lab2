# Lab 2 - Landing page

## Live Demo
[lab2.lumijiez.pro](https://lab2.lumijiez.pro)

## Description
I've created a coffee shop landing page, based on my absolute addiction to it. It features well-designed elements such as cards, perfectly picked color palettes, and premium design choices that I've "transpiled" from my usual Svelte/React tech stack onto Vanilla.
It has a pretty hero container, made to catch the user's attention quickly, and big sections, featuring some key points about the business, a little story, a menu, a specials board, and contacts. I've used fontawesome for icons, hope that's okay, also certain linked fonts.

## Deployment & Screenshots
The website itself is deployed using Vercel @ [lab2.lumijiez.pro](https://lab2.lumijiez.pro), screenshots attached below.
